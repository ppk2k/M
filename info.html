<h1>About Dark Web</h1>
<p>The Dark Web refers to a portion of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines. It is often associated with illegal activities, but it is also used for privacy-focused communication and research.</p>
<p>The Dark Web was created to allow users to maintain privacy and anonymity online. It utilizes specific software, such as Tor, to access sites that are not available on the surface web.</p>
<p>The Dark Web has become a significant part of internet culture, but it is important to note that it can also be dangerous, as it harbors illegal activities such as the sale of illicit goods and services.</p>
